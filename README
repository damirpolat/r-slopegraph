12 December 2013

This is a small project demonstrating how [Edward Tufte style slopegraphs](http://charliepark.org/slopegraphs/) can be made with R and ggplot2.  The project consists of:

- slopegraph.r: the R script (requires ggplot2 library)
- cancer_survival_rates.csv: the raw data
- slopegraph-demo.r: creates example plot
